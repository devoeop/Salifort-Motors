# Salifort-Motors

Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.

As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, I have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked me with analyzing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention.

This project deals with analyzing a dataset and building predictive models that can predict whether an employee will leave the company and, also provide insights to the Human Resources (HR) department of a large consulting firm.

If I can predict employees' likelihood to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.
